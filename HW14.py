from math import factorial

print("Hello World!")
#1. Create a variable that asks the user for an integer and an empty intger variable.
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
y = int()
#2. Create a loop with a range from 1 to the number the user input.
while range(1,x):
    f = (factorial(x))
    break

#3. Use the loop to find the factorial of that number. A factorial of a number is that number multiplied
#by every number before it until you reach 1.
#For example: 5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

#4. Print the factorial.
