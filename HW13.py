print("Hello World!")
#1. Create a list containing 10 integers of your choice.
numlist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
#2. Create two empty variables named evenNumbers and oddNumbers.
evenNumbers = None
oddNumbers = None
#3. Make a loop that counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list.
#(HINT: The way to see if a number is even is if it is divisible by 2).

#figure out how to do 3
while True:
    if numlist[0] % 2 == 0:
        evenNumbers = 1
        oddNumbers = 0
        print(oddNumbers)


# Print the total count of even and odd numbers.
